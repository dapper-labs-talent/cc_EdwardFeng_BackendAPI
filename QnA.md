How long did this assignment take?

> 4-5 hours! It was one afternoon session.

What was the hardest part?

> I had a choice between perhaps using this chance to learn Go Lang and submiting an incomplete work (due to the 4hr constraint) or using something I am comfortable with (JavaScript and Express) and having a complete work. I went with the latter to showcase my full technical capability, so there was not any difficult part specifically.

Did you learn anything new?

> Nothing specific, but it has definitely been awhile since I last use JavaScript and Express, so it was nice to refresh my JavaScript skill again. (These days I mostly use Java for work and Python for coding question.)

Is there anything you would have liked to implement but didn't have the time to?

> There are many!
>
> 1. Could use TypeScript for better typing.
> 2. Unit tests! It is always important to write unit tests for your work.
> 3. Lots of DevOps work could be done. Could look to containerize the server. Potentially have the CI pipeline setup as well.

What are the security holes (if any) in your system? If there are any, how would you fix them?

>

Do you feel that your skills were well tested?

> Yes, I like this take home assignment and it is a better way to assess candidates than, say, a leetcode style coding question.

Tool Use
